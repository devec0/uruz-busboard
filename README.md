Uruz Bus Board for Eurorack
===========================

An OSHW bus board for Eurorack power connectors.
The +5V regulator is optional, and only needed if you don't supply +5V to the input of the bus board.
Includes power LEDs for each voltage rail. Can be daisy-chained with multiple boards using the additional pass connector.

Warranty
========

This bus board will destroy everything you plug into it, remove bookmarks from the books you are reading, and spoil any nearby milk.
Do not use it, and especially don't blame me if something bad happens.
